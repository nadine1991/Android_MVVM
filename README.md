# Android_MVVM

Android Dog Breed App:
The app is fetching the images and data from dog breed api in a dropdown list, the user can pick one of them and added its image by id to the recycle view, I have used the MVVM architecture since it preserves the state of the UI and seperate logic from UI...

The folloing techniques I have used are:
☆ MVVM
☆ Coroutines
☆ Retrofit
☆ API
☆ LiveData
☆ Observers
